# CS-250
CS-250 sprint review and retrospective 
Steven Anderson

During this assignment and term I focused on how to match a user's needs when creating a project. 

To interpret and deliver on the user needs I used to user stories that detailed what the client or user would like to see implimented into the program. From there I would break down the story and figure out what code would be needed for the new features, if it would require a rewrite or a whole new section of code. Then I would write the coce for the user story feature and test it until I was certain it matched the client request. These user stories were great for the client to reach out to a development team in order for the dev team to understand the purpose and desires of the client by giving them a useful dated concept idea, these stories could also be useful when a tester is leaving a suggestiong for the dev team on how a part or design of the program might be improved.

When approaching development of programs I wish to use the agile approach of breaking it down into phases. That way I can test as I go and I don't have to plan the whole project from the beginning but am able to add to previous code that I know works. Going forward the best use of agile for me will be the initial planning of breaking down the code that has to be written into the seperate phases. 

Being a good team member on a development team means being a good team player. If someone on the team is struggling don't leave them to figure it out alone, help them to learn or take on the challenge together. Likewise don't suffer alone if you are stuck, let your team know so you don't bog down the team trying to figure something out that challenges you. Also being a good team member involves communicating with your team with your opinions and listening to theirs so you can develop the best possible project.
